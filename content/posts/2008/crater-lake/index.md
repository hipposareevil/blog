Ingrid and I went down to Crater Lake for the weekend.  The van did a good job of getting us there and back with no issues.  On Saturday we finished the drive from just outside of Oakridge to the lake.  We hung out at a pullout on the rim and read and napped for the day.

We camped that night just north of Diamond Lake at a horse camp that was full of horses.  On Sunday we went back to the lake and rode around the loop on our bikes.  It was around 35 miles and 3700 feet of elevation gain.  We did it in under 3 hours, which is pretty good considering we were at 7000 feet and lazy.
