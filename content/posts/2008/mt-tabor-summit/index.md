Mt. Tabor finally got enough snow for Matt, Keevin and I to make a West face summit attempt.  It took us all day and we barely eeked up some of the upper sections, but we finally summited after a gallant race up shirtless by Keevin and Matt.  We got to practice techniques learned by the Mazamas and invent our own as well.
