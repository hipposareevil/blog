On Saturday we went up to Seattle to rescue my car from the clutches of the gremlins.  Ding helped out Ingrid while I just hobbled around.  In a half hour she had it fixed and we were ready to go back to Portland.  We hung out with Sara and her friend for a while before wanting to go get stuck in traffic near Olympia.
