We went over to Sunriver for Dan's birthday.  We were going to go practice our mountaineering stuff but the weather sucked and we couldn't find a slope without little kiddies on their inner tubes.  So I pushed Ingrid into the snow and ran away.  Dan and Kate bought some crabs and we tried to eat them but none of us are coasties so we just ruined the crabs.
