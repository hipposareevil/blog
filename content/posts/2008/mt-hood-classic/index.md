This week the <a href="http://www.mthoodcyclingclassic.com/">Mt. Hood Classic</a> was racing downtown and on Mt. Tabor. Tuesday they raced downtown on the waterfront and the winner averaged 37mph.  I barely hit 32 on my way home.On Wednesday they did around 20 laps on Mt. Tabor, averaging a speed of 26mph.  Matt and I rode 4 laps on the same route on Monday.  I thought we did quite well and our best time was just under 4:10.  These guys did 2:45 laps.  While they raced a hundred miles the next day, we had trouble riding to work.
