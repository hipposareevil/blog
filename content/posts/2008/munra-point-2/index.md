We went into the Gorge to hike up Munra Point.  It was a perfect day and the trail was fairly dry.  This didn't stop me from falling on my ass on the way down though.  We saw salmon in the river (or sturgeon if you ask Matt.)  The top of the hike is the coolest location in the Gorge that I've been on, but you can see for yourself below.
