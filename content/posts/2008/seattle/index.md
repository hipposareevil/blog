Ingrid and I went up to Seattle to hang out with Sara and to buy a <a href="http://estore.websitepros.com/1764795/-strse-153/Hilleberg%2C-two-person-tent%2C/Detail.bok">new tent</a>.  Sara made us a badass stew in a crock pot and we ate cookies as well.  What diet?  Did I mention we joined Fatty Bowl 2008?  It's lame or la-may as the French call it, but we've lost some weight which helps keeping you hungry.</p><p>We went tubing at Snoqualmie pass on Sunday, along with everyone else and their grandma.  We ditched the tubing and just slid on our butts on some little hill that was more fun anyway. </p></p>As we tried to leave Seattle my car decided to break a fuel pump and not start.  So we took a ride down to the airport in Sara's new car and got a rental car to Portland.  Next weekend will be us going back to Seattle to repair said pump.
