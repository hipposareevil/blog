Ingrid, Jeremy (JT), and I went to Washington to hike up Dog Mountain.  We brought our snow shoes because we love them and wanted to try them out on cambered slopes and still post hole.  It was really cool and we turned around because of the Yeti and their pet snow sharks.  I fell on my ass and the Yeti laughed at me.  By the way, snow shoes don't really take away the suckage of going up hill, without them you can just turn around earlier.
