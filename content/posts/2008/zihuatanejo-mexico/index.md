Last weekend Ingrid and I went down to Zihuatanejo for a few days to hang out.  As I still can't walk too well or far, we mainly stayed around the hotel and made small trips out to get food.

We walked through the market a few times and I wanted to show her a tortilla maker.  So we were going down a street and I looked into a store and then went back one and asked them where they make tortillas.  After a minute I realized they were saying that the store just next door makes them.
