Ingrid and I hiked up Dog Mountain as it was to be a sunny day.  I went up in my new mountaineering boots which made it difficult to keep up with Ingrid on the steep dirt.  Once we got to snow it was more comfortable.  It was a beautiful day and we got to try out new hot chocolate made with coconut milk (I still prefer normal milk).
