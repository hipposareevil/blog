I went up Dog Mountain to work off Thanksgiving food.  I think last year Ingrid and I did it in 1:20, today I made it up in 1:00:10, just missing under an hour.  My average heart rate was 158, just about my anaerobic threshold, for the whole time.  It was nice and snowy and cold up top, sometimes bad weather makes it more exciting.
