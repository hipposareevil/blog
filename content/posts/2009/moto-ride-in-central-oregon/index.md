Ingrid and I went on our first overnight moto trip to central Oregon.  We took the backroads from The Dalles through Condon and down to Spray.  The roads were uber clear and no police to catch us going a few mph over the speed limit.  We stayed in Spray and after having some grubbing cafe food we got the best beer money can buy - MGD.  After dispensing with the half rack, we walked around the town and visited the local ducks and geese - who say 'hi' by the way.  The next day we took a different road through nowhere <a href="http://vimeo.com/6172887">back</a> to Condon for some much needed ice cream.
