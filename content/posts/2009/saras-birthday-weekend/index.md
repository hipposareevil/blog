Sara's Birthday was this weekend and I went out to Hood River to celebrate it with her and her sister MaryAnn.  On Saturday we ate Cheezits and went cross country skiing at TeacCup Lake.  We got lapped two times by one gal.  But we had hot cocoa and sandwiches and she didn't.  On Sunday we went up North towards Mt. Adams and skiied in the sun up to some <a href="http://www.a2zgorge.info/area/GulerIceCaves.htm">ice caves.</a>  It was very cool and it'd be nice to go back there with some crampons and a helmet.  It was a cool weekend hanging out and learning which muscles you normally don't use while skiing.
