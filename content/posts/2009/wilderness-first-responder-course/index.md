I took a <a href="http://www.wildmed.com/">Wilderness First Responder</a> course at PSU the last weekend and week.  It was a really in depth class and we got a lot of information.  The coolest part was doing simulations of patients that were hurt or sick and we'd access them.  In almost all of them I (and everyone else) would miss one thing or another that was critical.  But after doing that I now remember what not to do again.  So hopefully if the situation ever comes up I'll be prepared.  We dealt with everything from Acute Stress Reaction (freaking out) to brain injuries requiring an evacuation.
