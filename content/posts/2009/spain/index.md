Ingrid and I traveled to Spain for a little over a week to visit our friends Eric and Eli in Malage on the Mediterranean. On All Saints Day we went up to Antequera with their family to see the cool rock formations.  A few days in we traveled north to Granada to see the Alhambra and Albayzin - where we had a very nice hotel room.  We also made it with Eric and Eli to the caves in Nerja, which were pretty cool.  As we missed the Alcazaba of the Alhambra, we went to downtown Malaga and visited their Alcazaba which was uncrowded and very cool.
