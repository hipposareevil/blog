This weekend Ingrid and I went up to Mt. St. Helens and rode with our buddies Sara and Kevin.  After getting crushed by the Plains of Abraham we took showers at the van and then rolled over to the Lewis River to impose on Vince and his family camping there.  After I got us lost we showed up in time to eat their brownies and go to sleep.  The next day we rode the Lewis River trail, which seemed more up than last time.  But the quesadillas at the end made it ok.
