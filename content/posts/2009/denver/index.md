Ingrid and I flew over to Denver to see Wes and Phyl.  They plied us with martinis and 18oz steaks after making us brush their cats.  Strange folks.  We got up to the Bucksnort Tavern which is a great ride if you are on a motorcycle, a little scary if you're being driven by Wes.  We got to check out his new Triumph and pour some motor oil on his back yard as it's too nice.
