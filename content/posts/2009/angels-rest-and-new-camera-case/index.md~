I recently bought a new camera case called the <a href="https://www.climbing.com/news/free-hand/">Alpinist case</a> for schleping my camera when climbing.  As I'm in no shape to climb outside yet, I thought I would go up the grueling hike to <a href="http://nwhiker.com/CGNSAHike07.html">Angels Rest</a> to work off 2 Cheez-it crackers and try the case.  It's designed to be used with one hand for climbing and such and after a bit I got it down and it's pretty slick.  So it should do on my 5.2 climbs this summer.
