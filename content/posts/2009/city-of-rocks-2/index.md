We had our selves another trip to the City of Rocks in Idaho.  Ingrid's dad came with and got in some climbing as well.  There was less climbing this year as I had a few sicknesses.  This didn't stop Ingrid from leading her first trad (5.9).  Or stop the van from having its annual 'somethinggowrong' event.  This years events consisted of lights going funky, speedo breaking, and water pump issues.  The hammer brought it back inline though.
