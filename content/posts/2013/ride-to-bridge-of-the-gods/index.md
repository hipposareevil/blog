Terry, Kyle, Paul and I got together last Thursday to make a decision about the Rainier trip.  The weather looked pretty crummy and none of us wanted to bike for three days and end up sitting in a hotel or tent in the rain.  Kyle had always wanted to ride out to the Bridge Of The Gods (and back).  So a consolation prize was a long ride Saturday.  We will hopefully get a weather and vacation window that lines up properly for a Rainier ascent in July.
