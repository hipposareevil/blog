Ing and I went to Maui for a long weekend to enjoy the sun and warm water that's actually see through.  We snagged a convertible, which is the way to roll around the island if you don't have a bike.  We stayed the majority of the time in a B&B without the second B where there were tons of birds, toads and even geckos to keep us company.  On our last night we switched over to a small hotel in Paia to be closer to the ocean and coffee.
