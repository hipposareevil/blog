A bunch of us (Angel, Jen, Ron, Matt, Esther, me, Scott and Jami) went over to Smith Rock to climb in the 90 degree heat and complain about our shoe rubber melting onto our feet.  On Saturday we climbed Rabbit Stew (5.7 trad) and Bunny Face (5.7 sport) - very manly type climbs.  It got too hot in the afternoon to do much more climbing.  I as usual freaked out on lead, but I'm getting used to it.

On Sunday Ron and I got up earlish and ran over to Spiderman.  We were going to do it "quickly" so we could meet up with Jen and Angel over near Cinnamon Slab and get them up a few routes.  It took us like 4 hours to top out and walk over to rapell down to the ladies who were waiting in the heat.  The climb was great going up and Ron was psyched to do it.
