Over the 4th of July weekend we (Esther, Keevin, Matt and I) went over to Eastern Oregon to tackle the Middle Sister.  We had plans to do the "East Arete" as it looked like a super cool line with some easy rock climbing inbetween technical snow climbing.

On Saturday we climbed at Smith to get warmed up and practice our trad placement.  I started talking to an older guy next to us about the East Arete on Middle Sister.  He told us outright that it was shitty rock and unprotectable.  So there went that.

So we switched up to doing the North-East ridge instead.  We went through Sisters after finishing climbing and got some awesome pizza at Martoleous? before heading up to camp.  We got up and left camp at 4am and were on the summit around noon.  There wasn't anything really technical and we definetly had more gear than necessary with pickets, rope, crampons, axes and tools.  But better to have than not.
