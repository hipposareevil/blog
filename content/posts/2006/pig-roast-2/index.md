Last weekend I threw another pig roast.  We learned a few things from the last years roast, namely to start drinking beer earlier.  This year I got larger lava rock from the Cascades and we started the fire earlier and had about 8 hours of rock cook time.
The pig ended up getting cooked to 160 degrees by 1pm, in just 5 hours.  Where as last year it took at least 10 hours to get to 140.  So it was more sucessful with the hotter rock.  Steve (the pig) came out nicely cooked at 173 degrees and the skin just fell off and it was very easy to get the meat off of Steve.
