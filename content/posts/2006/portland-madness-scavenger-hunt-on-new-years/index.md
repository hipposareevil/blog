For New Years I went out with Aimee, Kim and Matt to the first annual Portland Madness Scavenger Hunt.  We were team <emphasis>We Like Big Jugs</emphasis> (A technical climbing term).  Our mascott was named <emphasis>Hotness</emphasis>.  You'll see her in each picture.  We had to take pictures with Hotness at various place around town, only taking public transportation.  Each team had a theme and we were climbers, thus our name.

We didn't quite come in first place but we had a kickass time, I even got my name and hand into the paintings at the end of the night.  They showed everyones pictures from the night, which was pretty damn cool.  Here are ours:
