This weekend Jami, Matt, Keevin and I went up to Beacon Rock in Washington to practice our trad climbing.  I had done the route last year with my buddy Ben.  Unfortunetely this time I didn't drink enough water and got dehydrated to the point of having trouble talking.  I'm sure my partner Jami really enjoyed that.  We didn't get lost per se, but I wasn't 100% sure of where to go after 4 or so pitches.  A friend was up on a different route and gave us enough beta to get off the damn rock.  Keevin and Matt were at the bottom wondering where the hell we were and even talked to the rangers to look for us.  Anyway, here are our pics.
