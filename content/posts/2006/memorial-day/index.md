Over Memorial Day a bunch of us went down to Bend to do climbing at Smith Rocks and biking at Phil's Trail and the Whoo-De-Doos.  As usual it was kick ass.  Ron's friends Adam and Angel came down and did their first climb every and did really well and (I think) had an awesome time.  My buddy Sara and woman Becky drove all the way from Seattle and said they had a good time even though they had to wait all day for us to string up some ropes for them.
