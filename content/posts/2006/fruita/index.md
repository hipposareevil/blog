Ron and I just got into Moab after spending the weekend in Fruita, Colorado.  We did a few days of biking and some climbing as well.  

Ron and I climbing near Fruita in Colorado National Monument. I did my first 5.6 trad lead, which scared the shit out of me and maybe even Ron as I freaked out on him as well as myself on the wall.
