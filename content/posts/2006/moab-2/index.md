Trey, Henry and Dan came down to Moab this Tuesday and joined up with Ron and I.  We started off with Monitor Merimack - as per custom, and then did Bartlet Slickrock and Amasa Back. <br /> After riding we've gone climbing twice so far.  The first was a warm up on Potash Road (Wall Street).  Dan and I went up the Fist Full Of Potash (5.10).  Yesterday we drove out to Sunshine Wall and put up some top ropes on a nice slab with some 5.9s and 5.10s.
