Last weekend Jill and I went up to Cape Alava on the Olympic Penninsula in Washington.  It's a cool hike in to the beach - 3 miles of mostly boardwalk hiking through a rain forest.  We got an awesome campsite right next to the beach on soft grass.

We lucked out with the weather and got sun and clear skies until Sunday morning when we were sleeping in my condo of a tent. We spent most of the time hanging out and going on short hikes down the beach.  I showed Jill I was still mature enough to swear at the stove when I couldn't get it to work.  That passed and we were able to to eat our mushy pasta dinner with a side of Gatorade.
