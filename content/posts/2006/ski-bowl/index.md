Dan and I went up to Mt. Hood for our second ski of the season.  Last weekend we went up with Ron, Esther and Keevin to Timberline.  The weather wasn't so good last time, but today it was super nice out.  We skinned up twice and then called it a day.  Next time we'll get some lift tickets so we can get in a few more turns.

In case the picture of Dan crashing isn't large enough,<a href="/2006/skiBowl/dan_crash.jpg">here is a bigger version.</a></p>
