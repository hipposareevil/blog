Last weekend I went up Mt. St. Helens with a few of my climbing buddies.  I have no pictures of the adventure because I still don't have a digicam.  But, it was pretty fun (except for the last hour, that's pretty tough.)  Maureen and I glacaded (sp?) down from the top for about 3 miles.  That was pretty kick ass, even got air a few times.  Brynee and I decided we're gonna do other mountains next year.  Which probably means I need to bump my bi-weekly 3 mile jog up a little bit.
