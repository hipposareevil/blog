So I've started digging out an area for the hot tub.  I'm going to put down gravel layer, then paper, then a sand layer and then the pavers.  I'm almost done with the hole, just another 3x12 foot section.  I just ordered the owners manual from JW Enterprises in California so someone will be able to hook up the tub for me.

Soon I'll have a toasty warm tub to hang out in.
