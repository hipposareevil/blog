On Saturday, I went up to Mt. Hood to go snow shoeing with one of my climbing buddies Brynne.  The weather was pretty nice, just a little below freezing and some sunshine.  The snow was pretty crunchy, so we didn't really even need the shoes.  But, it's more fun to clop around with big ass slats strapped to your feet.

After we walked up and down around the lake, we took a drive up to Timberline Lodge to have some hot chocolate.  Well, she had a beer and I had melted chocolate.
