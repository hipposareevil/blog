Went up to St. Arnaud to hike above [Parachute Rocks](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/nelson-tasman/places/nelson-lakes-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/st-arnaud-range-track/). It was uber windy and finally got out the Bothy bag to stay warm while we had hot chocolate. Used the microspikes for the hike down as the snow was bit icy and slippy.
