We went to Kaikura for a long weekend for Rachel's birthday. Stayed at a [cool renovated barn](https://www.cubbyhousestay.co.nz/) outside of town. Oscar got to feed a pig, a baby lamb, a few cows, and a cool turkey. We took a half day cooking course where we made fresh noodles and a meringue dessert. Was very cool.
