Stayed in cabin at [Gentle Annie](https://gentleannie.co.nz/) for first weekend of term break. Oscar's buddy Arthur and his family came and stayed for a few days. The beach was just like the Oregon coast and they played in the sand all days. We had a few fires on the beach with bigass marshmallows. Easter was celebrated early this year and they did a small hunt inside as the Wekas outside would've eaten all the candy.
