I came across a cool [media tracker](https://media.ginatrapani.org/) and searched around for some open source version of it.  Two hours later I realized I could use AI to create one, so I make an account over on [lovable](https://lovable.dev) and started 'coding'.

Three hours later I had a very usable web page that I could pull from github and put on my website.

To make something like this by hand would probably take 4 weeks and I had it here up in hours. Glad I got out of programming when I did.
