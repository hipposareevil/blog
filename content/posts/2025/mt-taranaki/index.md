I went over to New Plymouth to climb Mt. Taranaki. I went up in afternoon to stay the night at [Tahurangi Lodge](https://taranakialpineclub.co.nz/tahurangi-lodge/). The hut had warm water, pillows, charging stations, fridge, everything you'd want in a hut. I ate my freeze dried meal and went to bed early. 

A 3am wakeup had me on the trail at 3:45. There was a large section with stairs, to get around erosion of the choss.  After the stairs there was more choss and then a bunch of boulders to climb around and over. 

I made pretty good time to the crater rim and then donned crampons and walked under the Sharks Fin. AFter going under the Fin I realized I should've just gone straight right up to the summit. So I slowly made way over to base of proper summit and went up the icy snow. Spent twenty minutes on top looking around and then downclimbed to the trail and hiked out.
