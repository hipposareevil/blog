Oscar had a [triathalon](http://tryathlon.co.nz) up in Nelson over the weekend so we went up one day early to get some hamburgers and shakes. The next day we showed up along with half of the country. Oscars race was a swim/run through the ocean and then a run (next year he can ride a bike for the 2nd stage.)  He had heaps of fun and was worn out.
