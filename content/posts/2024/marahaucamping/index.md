Long weekend camping at [Old Macs](https://www.oldmacs.co.nz/) in Mārahau, just near start of Abel Tasman track. We stayed in camp mostly as dogs are not allowed pretty much anywhere. Oscar got to paddle around on our SUP and a small kayak that lives at the watering hole. We used our new day tent and Oscar has his own tent attached to it. Worked out nicely.  On way home we got him his own kayak and a new bike with gears.
