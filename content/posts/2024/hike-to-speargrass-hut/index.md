Our second overnight tramp was to [Speargrass Hut](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/nelson-tasman/places/nelson-lakes-national-park/things-to-do/huts/speargrass-hut/). It was a longer way in than last time but Oscar made it through pretty easily. There were lots and lots of roots, and in his words a dumb river crossing. He found a perfect walking stick that should do well for him. The flies were pretty bad, and I found two more bug repellents that don't work. It rained over night and was a little misty on the walk out so we suited up and took our time down the slick hills. Afterwords we got some chips for the drive home.
