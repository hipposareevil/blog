First warm water dive, barely needed a wet suit (27C).  Saw a reef shark and a cool sunken trawler. On the second dive the boat was not there as the mooring had broken. After 45 min the boat came back and we all had biscuits. Was a reminder to bring the safety sausage and always have the PRB with us.
