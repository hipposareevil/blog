Sara and I hiked the long hike out to Third Beach to eat steak and camp for two nights. The sun was out the entire time and we were treated to sixty degree weather during the day. Our camp was just a few feet above the high tide line, so we were woke up by the waves.  There were very few people on the beach, considering how awesome the weather was.

Sara brought out a cast iron skillet to cook our eggs and bacon, along with a few nice steaks.  I contributed almond milk.

At night Jupiter, Venus and Mars stuck their heads out until the Moon showed up and shone everywhere.
