Intention is everything, right? Rachel and I intended to do an awesome three day bike loop on serene gravel roads. Short story brief, we bailed at Tygh Valley to go back to Dufur and the hotel. The scenery was super awesome, the heat not so much. On one hand we could camp in 90deg weather, orrr have cold cider in a nice hotel. Cider and hotel won out.
