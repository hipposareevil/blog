We took another cooking class at the [Hapuku Kitchen](https://www.hapukukitchen.co.nz/) just outside of Kaikoura. This time it was an outdoor focused lesson. We made bread, garlic butter for said bread, a rhubarb crumble, lamb, and a fish. Mainly we stood around and drank mint cordials and hung out in front of a cool fire.
