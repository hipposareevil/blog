I went up to Sara's cabin to show those heathens how to burn corn on a grill and later to shove chocolate into bananas on the grill.  In their defense they showed that peanut butter is a great addition.  Score 1 Washington. I spent a lot of time trying to take artsy photos of moon light on water.  Time would have been better spent learning the way of the corn grilling.

We hiked up Mt. Elanor to work up an appetite for dinner.
