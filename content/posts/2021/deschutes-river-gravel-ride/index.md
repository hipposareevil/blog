Took my skinny tires up to [Deschutes River](https://www.mountaineers.org/activities/trip-reports/bikepack-deschutes-river-state-recreation-area) for an easy gravel bikepacking ride. Easy ride up the gravel road to a camp site near the river. Most sites are used by rafters and the bugs that come out at dusk. A train rolls through the night, which is pretty cool even if you're woken up. I ate a bunch of undercooked steel-cut oats and glided back down to the car. Was definitely worth lugging up a tripod for night shots and a chair for sitting down. I brought extra chocolate chip cookies for the skunk that broke into my bag to eat my treats.
