### Moab
For Moab V I had no job so I was able to take an extended trip, going through Berkeley, Nevada, Zion and Monument Valley.
It was the first time I drove over 130mph.

Ron, Trey, Vince, Tom and I rode Amasa Back, Gemini Bridges, Slickrock, Moab Rim and Monitor Merimack.
I saw some freeriders the day after everyone left.  They made it down Moab Rim in 2 minutes, at an average of 30mph.
