Ingrid and I raced at the <a href="http://echored2red.com/2012_Echo_Red_2_Red_XC_MTB_Race/Home.html">Red 2 Red</a> race over in Echo.  There were hundreds of people, two of which were out of shape.  I knew it was going to be a hard day as the only thing I've practiced on my mountain bike was crashing on Skyline.  It was worse as we got pounded by 20-30 mph winds.  We both finished without mechanicals or cramps or losing our water bottles, which was the case for a lot of people.  I had a new <a href="http://www.geigerrig.com/">tricksy backpack</a> that shoots water instead of having to suck on the nozzle.  I thought it was crap until about 3 miles from the end when I saw what I was doing wrong.  Next time.
