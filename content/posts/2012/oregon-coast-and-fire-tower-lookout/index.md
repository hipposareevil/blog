I lucked out and snagged the <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/recreation/rentals/rrs-bolan-mt-lo.shtml">Bolan Fire Tower</a> in Southern Oregon for two nights.   I took a few days to enjoy a drive down the coast before my reservation.

I missed out on both the Crazy Norwegian's fish & chips and the Redwoods, both of which shouldn't be missed when one is in Southern Oregon.  I attempted to make up for it by purchasing cheezy-poofs and root beer in Cave Junction.

I made it up the rocky road to the fire tower in time to see the clouds foaming around the Cascade foothills.  Mt. Shasta showed itself the first day, before going into hiding behind the clouds.

Both days were spent eating sandwiches, reading books concerning vampires taking over the world or space operas.  Time well spent.
