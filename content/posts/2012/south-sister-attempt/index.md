I went down to Bend to go camp on summit of South Sister like last year.  I ended up turning around at 7500 feet as the snow had me concerned.  The weather turned for a while also, but mainly the snow making small cracks around my postholes were unsettling on my own.  I spent a few hours at the flats taking photos before going back down through the trees back to the car.
