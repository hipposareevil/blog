Sara and I spent a long weekend camping in the Enchanted Valley up in the Olympics.  It was a beautiful 13 mile hike up a gradual slope into the valley itself.  

Before heading in we chatted with the campground host and were introduced to a new mosquito repellant - immitation vanilla extract.  He's been using it for years and works for him.  It was nice to use something other than DEET that made us smeel nice.  I escaped the bugs with only a few bits, which is on par with the chemicals.

We spent two nights in the Valley with a day trip up to Anderson Pass (4500').  The hike went through a few avalanche debris fields that were awesome to see.  We booked out early on Sunday to avoid the heat and make it back to the lodge for grub and grass sitting.
