I left work early to hike up to Illumination Rock and get in some photos and camping.  I lucked out with great weather and views.  A few guides were already there with a group, practicing for a summit bid.  A pair of skiers came through camp and played around on the saddle, lending themselves to more good photos.  I opted out of night shots as it wasn't getting dark until late and I thought it wise to get sleep instead.

I woke up early in order to get back to town for work, only to see a near white out.  Maybe a slight exaggeration, but I was unable to see down the mountain with visibility at around 20 feet.  I took out my map and compass, realizing I should take a navigation course.  Luckily the tracks from the previous day were still usable and I followed them down to the top of the Palmer where it was visible again.

It was great to get out for just a quick hike and camp.  I had my fastest time to the top of the Palmer - 1:20, which was a nice result.  The views from Illumination Rock are excellent and I think my next route will be up Castle Crags, it looks fairly mellow with cool features.
