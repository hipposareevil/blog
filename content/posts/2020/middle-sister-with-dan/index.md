It's not Mt. Shasta, but Dan and I made a run for Middle Sister over the weekend. There was debate about bringing skis or not; I went with no skis, Dan went with skis. Dan was right. We had warm weather and postholed snow. Views were awesome and we had the whole set of mountains to ourselves as we left.
