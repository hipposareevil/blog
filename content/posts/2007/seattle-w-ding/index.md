Ingrid, Ding and I made a quick trip up to Seattle to hang out with Sara.  We had breakfast at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?client=opera&rls=en&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&um=1&q=dish&near=Seattle,+WA&fb=1&view=text&latlng=47660355,-122366073,12128487684074696783">Dish</a>, my favorite place in Seattle.  We went to the art exhibit downtown and after getting yelled at for touching the art we went over to the Market to watch donuts being made.
