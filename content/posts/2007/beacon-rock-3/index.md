On Tuesday Ron and I went up to Beacon Rock to get in some practice.  I've been wanting to do some simulclimbing to get ready for the Grand Teton in August.  We got in a few sections of simulclimbing using an ascender to protect the leader, I think it worked out pretty well.  The climbing was bomber and I felt pretty good on lead above the gear.  We'll be going up again in a week or two to get more practice.
