As our Mt. Hood trip failed, Ingrid, Keevin, Matt, Moria and I went over to Smith to redeem ourselves.  It partially worked.  Ingrid and I did an unnamed 5.8 multiptich sport route and then tried to do Spiderman. But there were two parties already on it, so we went over to Cinnamon slab to do a quick climb.  We saw some guy climbing a 5.13? near us so we watched him for a bit.
