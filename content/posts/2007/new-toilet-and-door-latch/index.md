Today Ron came over to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">help</span> fix my door latch.  After the door was fixed and the door knob didn't actually come out in your hand we moved on to the toilet.  After some nasty cleaning and looking into the bowels of hell we got the new one tightened down and ready for use.  Then I tried to get rid of a bunch of cardboard by pouring gasoline on them in the pig pit and lighting it.  Needless to say, there was huge amounts of smoke and ash which took 10 minutes to put out.
