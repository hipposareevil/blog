Alex came out to Portland for work and stayed at our place for two nights.  This is his out of focus picture.  We took him to see Blade Runner, which bored everyone but me and Keevin, and for some beer afterwords at a &quot;Portlandy&quot; place.

On Saturday morning Clif decided to come over and hang out for a little bit before I went to run stairs on Mt. Tabor with May, Jami and Mo.  Clif has put on a little winter weight but is still a cute little fucker.
