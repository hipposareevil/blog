Last weekend we went over to Smith Rock and climbed on Spiderman.  I freaked out at the crux, again, when my feet blew and I was hanging by my hands above my gear.  So that sucked.
After Ingrid and I got to the top, I rapped down to take pictures of Matt and Jeremy pulling the roof.  That was badass and made up for the cruxy screaming and swearing.
