Ron, Dan, Kate, Esther, Matt and I went over to Smith to get in some climbing.  Ron and I did Moscow (5.6) and it took forever.  Neither of us really enjoyed the climb but we got through it and went over to do a 5.9+ sport route afterwords.  Kate and Dan were working on a 5.11 climb and the light was good for pictures so most are of them.
