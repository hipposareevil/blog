On Saturday I went back to the Gorge to get my damn boots back.  As I'm paranoid, I brought up some rope and cordlette to help me get the boots out, as they were stuck fast last time I saw them.  I got down to where the boots were and was ready to rig up an elaborate system (maybe a 5:1 Z-C pulley system I learned in crevase rescue or some such).  There was only one boot and it was just lying there under a small waterfall and I could pull it out with little effort.  It came out unattached and with not much in the way of shoelaces.  I threw it to shore (which could have gone bad again I realized while it was in midair).  I tried to search around in the pool of water for the other one, but the water is too damn cold.

I got out of the water with help from my really unnecessary rope and carabineers.  I didn't biff it into the water, so I guess it was all helpful.  I walked down the stream, I mean river, for a ways and couldn't see my other boot.  I think it was hiding from me under a rock or a branch, probably thinking I wasn't worthy of wearing it.  I got back to my bag and solitary boot and packed out to the car.  At least I have one boot to add to my growing collection of crap on my front porch.
