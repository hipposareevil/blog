Last weekend I went up to Seattle to hang out with Sara for a few days.  We came across a kitchy store and inside they had <a href="http://www.uglydolls.com">Ugly Dolls</a>.  They are quite ugly, but I bought <a href="http://www.shopatron.com/product/part_number=10071/322.0.8768.0.0.0.0">a bat</a> for Ingrid.  We decided to take Ding (the bat's name) around Seattle and document his adventures for Ingrid.

We took Ding to the aquarium, to an Italian pizza place, to beer, to a park, to breakfast and then to mojitos.  Below are his adventures.
