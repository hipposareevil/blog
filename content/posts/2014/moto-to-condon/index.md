<h2>Trip</h2>
Rachel and I took an awesome two night trip to Central Oregon.  First night was at the really cool Balch Hotel in Dufur.  We took the nice windy roads down and over to the Painted Hills for a cheese and cracker lunch like civilized people.  The last night was at the Condon Hotel, where we had our own bathroom and they gave us beer once we settled in. More awesome roads the next morning led us back home.
