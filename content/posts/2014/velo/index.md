Kyle and his buddies were riding the backroads of Oregon from South to North over the course of this week.  I was invited but I'm lame and couldn't go, so I told him I'd come over and pick them up.  It originally started as me doing the whole ride, then joining up and doing 3 days, then just one day riding, to eventually me just driving to them.

I played sag wagon and drove around trying to take fuzzy pictures of them and deliver ice-cream sandwiches.  It was super awesome out and I was supremely jealous of the riding they had, it was fun just to see where they were riding.  It for sure has to go on the todo list.
