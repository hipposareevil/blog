<h2>Ride</h2>
I took off towards Moro for the weekend on the moto (Gwen as Rachel has named her).  Spent first night in a RV with some deer and then heading on the awesome roads to Mt. Adams.  Jo Ellen was kind and let me crash at her place at Trout Lake, with awesome company, views and Amarullo from Africa.  On Sunday I took the awesome dirt roads west out of town home via the Gorge.
