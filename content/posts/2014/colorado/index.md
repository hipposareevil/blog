Went over to Colorado to hang out with Dan & Kate.  We climbed some horrendous "5.7" that beat me down, even with my Alex Honnold shirt.  

The next day we went over to Quandary Peak to ski our first 14er.  I won't lie, my feet hurt and it was scary to ski down at 13.5, but Dan had the chocolate so I had to keep going down.
