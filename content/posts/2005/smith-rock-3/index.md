This weekend all of us went out to Smith Rock to celebrate Kate and Sandra's birthday with some rock climbing.  Friday night was some beer drinking and fire starting until 2am.  On Saturday after a breakfast of bacon, coffee, bagels, pancakes and warm beer, we headed over into the park.

Brynne, May and I went to Wherever I May Roam, a 5 pitch climb.  Brynne lead the pitches, I went send and May came up after me.  On the bottom I broke a hold which funked up my zen.  The first 3 pitches were ok, on the second I had issues and fell a few times (once cos a fart made me laugh and fall off).

I was following up the 3rd pitch and was having some issues with it when a guy above us started to throw his ropes down right on top of us to rappel.  He was talking to Brynne, who was belaying me and I was freaking out so I yelled at her "Hey, tell those fuckers to not rappel onto us!"  The guy was like 30 feet above and yelled back "Did you just call us fuckers?!?"  I told him yea but to ignore it.  Brynne thought it was funny.  They rappeled down after I got up to the anchors and then Brynne had to help them untangle their rope so I figure we were even.  He was busy yelling at his girlfriend about something anyway.

The next 2 pitches were lots of fun and made up for the first 3.  On top we had great views and saw our other climbing buddies over near Asterisk Pass.  We did a single rope rappel, then a 60 foot double rope rappel cos the ropes didn't touch the ground.  Then we did one last one.  I couldn't see if the rope touched the deck or not but when I went about 100 feet down I could see it was a few feet above the ground, so we went for it.  My weight stretched the rope enough to touch.

We were all done and took off after getting some snack food and met up with everyone else in the parking lot.  After telling everyone of our epic climb and the yelling we went to the 7th Street pub in Redmond.

We had a good time drinking and eating before heading back to the grasslands camping area.  Where we stood around a fire and jabbered over beer.

After a frosty night we got up early and headed back out to Smith so May could do her first lead - which she kicked ass on.  We talked to the guys next to us and they had heard about my yelling at the dude on Saturday.  So the word got out. We did a few easy climbs and May and I called it a day and bailed to go home and sit in hot tubs.
