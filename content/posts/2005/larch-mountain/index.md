On Saturday Aimee, her buddy Erica, Kala and I went for a hike up to Larch Mountain.  We dropped Erica's car off at Multnomcah Falls and hiked in through Horsetail Falls.  We actually didn't make it up to Larch Mountain, I had the bright idea that the map wasn't right and that I was.  So we headed down trail 427 towards Larch Mountain trail.

After going a mile down a really cool ridge we realized the other trail was the one we wanted, but it was late and we were lazy.  And someone mentioned ice cream cones - that's enough to not hike back up the hill.  We went down to Multnomah Falls and pushed past the little fat kids and grabbed ourselves some cones.
