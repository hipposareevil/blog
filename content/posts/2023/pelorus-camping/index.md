Weekend camping at Pelorus Bridge up in the valley. Our first spot was just a place to park the car in some dirt, so we were able to switch to a nice grass spot for our tent. Camp sites don't have tables or fire rings like back in Oregon. There is a large communal building with showers, tables, and stoves. It was pretty nice.
