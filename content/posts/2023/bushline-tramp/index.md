We went on our first overnight tramp to [Bushline hut](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/nelson-tasman/places/nelson-lakes-national-park/things-to-do/huts/bushline-hut/). It was a little hard going in, but then Oscar had a great time playing around with some other kids up there. M&Ms were key for the hiking.
